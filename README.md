# The Fairy Door

## Inspiration
We wanted to share the parts of Ann Arbor that make it unique and help people rediscover their city.
## What it does
It allows users to plan their day based on information provided by locals about special deals or unique sights that would normally be neglected in a typical tours, trip planer, and commonly used resources such as Google Maps and Yelp.
## How We built it
We used Bulma, Python, Flask, and the Google Maps API. 
## Challenges We ran into
Acknowledging the difficulties of managing and balancing project features and workflow within the given frame.
## Accomplishments that We are proud of
Developing an working demo of the app.
## What We learned
Learning the Google Maps API and integrating it Flask.
## What's next for Fairy Door
Filters to help users customize their experience. Social features that allow users to add custom locations and routes. Live sharing of transient events or points of interest, such as chalk art or the monster violinist. Support for biking, driving, et cetera. Adding other premade routes, such as a fairy door path, Ann Arbor art and murals paths, or even a Zingerman's food tour.
